    Talk: Learn to Test - Automata Learning for Formal Testing<br>
    In this talk, we will provide an overview of our research in automata learning for the testing of black-box systems, i.e., systems without access to source code.
    Automata learning, also known as grammar inference or model mining, infers finite-state models from observations at the interface of a system.
    Our tools are capable of learning deterministic, stochastic, and timed models in the form of Mealy machines, MDPs, and Timed Automata.
    These learned models can be used to automatically test system components externally.
    Recent application domains include IoT protocols (Bluetooth LE, MQTT), cars (driver models, autonomous driving), and reinforcement learning.
    Most recently, we are investigating the synergies between machine learning and automata learning in both directions, i.e., machine learning to assist automata learning and automata learning to assist machine learning.
    For easier integration with machine-learning frameworks, we have developed AALpy, an open-source Active Automata Learning library for Python:

    Talk: Dumb but fast >> smart and slow: fast grammar inference on GPUs<br>
    GPUs are the work-horses of high-performance computing.
    The acceleration they provide to applications compatible with their programming paradigm can surpass CPU performance by several orders of magnitude, as notably evidenced by the advancements in deep learning.
    A significant spectrum of applications, including grammar inference has yet to reap the benefits of GPU acceleration.<br>
    In this talk I will give an overview of recent work on GPU acceleration of grammar induction that has lead to state-of-the-art results, with orders of magnitude improvements for regular expressions and LTL (linear temporal logic, a subsystem of regular expressions, widely used in industrial verification) inference.
