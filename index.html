<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
    The fifth edition of "Learning and Automata" (LearnAut) will possibly be held at <a href="https://compose.ioc.ee/icalp2024/">ICALP/LiCS/FSCD 2024</a> in Tallinn (Estonia) sometime in July 2024.
</p>


<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
    Learning models defining recursive computations, like automata and formal grammars, are the core of the field called Grammatical Inference (GI).
    The expressive power of these models and the complexity of the associated computational problems are major research topics within mathematical logic and computer science.
    Historically, there has been little interaction between the GI and ICALP communities, though recently some important results started to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic who could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new fruitful applications for their methods.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
     The LearnAut workshop will consists of a number of invited talks, other talks from researchers who submitted their work to the workshop, and discussions. An important amount of time will be kept for interactions between participants.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly to how main machine learning conferences and workshops are organized, all accepted abstracts will be part of a poster session held during the workshop.
    Additionally, the Program Committee will select a subset of the abstracts for oral presentation.
    At least one author of each accepted abstract is expected to represent it at the workshop.
